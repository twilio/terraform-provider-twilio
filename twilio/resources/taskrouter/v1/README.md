--- | --- | --- | ---
**workspace_sid** | string | **Required** | The SID of the Workspace that the new Task belongs to.
**attributes** | string | Optional | A URL-encoded JSON string with the attributes of the new task. This value is passed to the Workflow&#39;s &#x60;assignment_callback_url&#x60; when the Task is assigned to a Worker.

**priority** | int | Optional | The priority to assign the new task and override the default. When supplied, the new Task will have this priority unless it matches a Workflow Target with a Priority set. When not supplied, the new Task will have the priority of the matching Workflow Target. Value can be 0 to 2^31^ (2,147,483,647).
**task_channel** | string | Optional | When MultiTasking is enabled, specify the TaskChannel by passing either its &#x60;unique_name&#x60; or &#x60;sid&#x60;. Default value is &#x60;default&#x60;.
**timeout** | int | Optional | The amount of time in seconds the new task can live before being assigned. Can be up to a maximum of 2 weeks (1,209,600 seconds). The default value is 24 hours (86,400 seconds). On timeout, the &#x60;task.canceled&#x60; event will fire with description &#x60;Task TTL Exceeded&#x60;.
**workflow_sid** | string | Optional | The SID of the Workflow that you would like to handle routing for the new Task. If there is only one Workflow defined for the Workspace that you are posting the new task to, this parameter is optional.

**if_match** | string | Optional | If provided, applies this mutation if (and only if) the [ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) header of the Task matches the provided value. This matches the semantics of (and is implemented with) the HTTP [If-Match header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Match).
**assignment_status** | string | Optional | The new status of the task. Can be: &#x60;canceled&#x60;, to cancel a Task that is currently &#x60;pending&#x60; or &#x60;reserved&#x60;; &#x60;wrapping&#x60;, to move the Task to wrapup state; or &#x60;completed&#x60;, to move a Task to the completed state.
**reason** | string | Optional | The reason that the Task was canceled or completed. This parameter is required only if the Task is canceled or completed. Setting this value queues the task for deletion and logs the reason.

## twilio_taskrouter_workspaces_v1

### Parameters

Name | Type | Requirement | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**friendly_name** | string | **Required** | A descriptive string that you create to describe the Workspace resource. It can be up to 64 characters long. For example: &#x60;Customer Support&#x60; or &#x60;2014 Election Campaign&#x60;.
**event_callback_url** | string | Optional | The URL we should call when an event occurs. If provided, the Workspace will publish events to this URL, for example, to collect data for reporting. See [Workspace Events](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/api/event) for more information.
**events_filter** | string | Optional | The list of Workspace events for which to call event_callback_url. For example, if &#x60;EventsFilter&#x3D;task.created, task.canceled, worker.activity.update&#x60;, then TaskRouter will call event_callback_url only when a task is created, canceled, or a Worker activity is updated.

Otherwise, each Worker will only receive a new reservation when the previous task is completed. Learn more at [Multitasking](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/multitasking).
**prioritize_queue_order** | string | Optional | The type of TaskQueue to prioritize when Workers are receiving Tasks from both types of TaskQueues.

**sid** | string | *Computed* | The SID of the Workspace resource to update.
**default_activity_sid** | string | Optional | The SID of the Activity that will be used when new Workers are created in the Workspace.
